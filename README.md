# Basic Virus Elements
 Basic virus elements to set virus execute at startup and moves virus to appdata directory

# To make it executable use:
```pyInstaller <file> --onefile --add-data <random_file>```


I don't take any responsibility for the bad/harmful usage of the code.

# Features
Sets itself to start at startup.
Copys itself to appdata directory.
Added fake/decoy file (pdf) to open when you run the program.
