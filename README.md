# Basic Virus Elements
 Basic virus elements to set virus execute at startup and moves virus to appdata directory

# To make it executable use:
```pyInstaller <file> --onefile```

After that when you run the program, it will set itself as executable at startup and copys itself to appdata as ```fakeupgrade.exe```.
You can change the virus part, for now it just writes "Hacked you" 100 times.
You can use the presistence part for your other codes.
I don't take any responsibility for the bad/harmful usage of the code.
